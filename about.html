    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="./Assets/about-me.JPG" height="400">
    <p>My name is Drew, and I am a cinematographer & editor based out of Bend, Oregon. <br><br>

    I have over 10 years experience in professional video production, specializing in directing, cinematography, editing, color correction, audio, and lighting. <br><br>

    Through my roles at Ruffwear, The University of Oklahoma, and my own wedding videography business, I have worked on a wide range of video projects. Whether itâ€™s educational content, highly-produced narratives, fun social media content, or cinematic wedding films, I am comfortable with whatever kind of video project comes my way. <br><br>

    In my free time, I enjoy fly fishing, skiing,  gaming, and traveling with my family.
